•	I want to record the results of an event
•	I want to list the results of an event including points

How to run the Programme
1.Navigate to the 'Main' folder(after 'src' but before 'java')
2.Open up command console in the Directory 
3.Type out 'java -jar SportsDay-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar'(or paste) or alternatively open and run in an IDE.


Getting Started

Add houses, events and year groups first which will allow you to then show these groups later on. 

Once this has been done you can add points/results and show results of races and houses and their points.

From the start you will be able to view the programme and exit the programme if needs be. If you accidentally 
choose the wrong key and wish to return to the main menu then simply press a random key and hit enter.
