This was the first project which I attempted in java where we had to recreate a school sports day management system. This project was extremely challenging as understanding
OOP was very tough due to various concepts. This project is very rough and not extremely refined unlike my others, however I guess it can be used to compare my progress and 
the changes in the way I thought whilst learning to code. Although this is not one of my best projects I still believe that there was a lot learned from this and it was
a vital part of my learning and setting me up for learning android development.
